## Parent problems
1. 0-1 knapsack (maximise profit from a given weight and value list with a fixed maximum weight Capasity.)
   - subset sum
   - equal sum partition
   - count of subset sum
   - minimal subset difference
   - target sum
   - number of subset with given difference
2. Unbounded knapsack (check UnboundedKnapsack class before checking child problems)
   - Rod cutting  = same as unbounded knapsack
   - coin change I = same as count of subset sum problem
   - coin change II
   - Maximum Ribbon cut
3. fibonacci
4. LCS
   - largest common substring
   - print LCS
   - shortest common super sequence
   - print SCS
   - Min numner of insertion and deletion for a -> b
   - largest repeating subsequence
   - length of largest subsequence of 'a' which is a subsequence in 'b'
   - subsequence pattern matching
   - count how many times a appears as subsequence in b
   - largest palindromic subsequence
   - largest palindromic substring
   - count of palindromic sunstring
   - min no of deletion in a string to make it a palindrom
   - min no of insertions in a string to make it a palindrom
5. LIS
6. Kadane's Algorithm
7. Matrix chain multiplication
8. DP on trees
9. DP on grids
10. Others
